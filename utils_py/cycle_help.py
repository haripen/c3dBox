def extract_cycle_periods(event_times, event_labels, cycles_from_to):
    """
    Extract cycle time ranges from aligned event times and labels.

    Supports cycle definitions with either 2 or 3 events.
    
    For a 2-event definition [start, end]:
      - If start and end labels are identical, consecutive occurrences are paired.
      - If they differ, the first occurrence of the end event following each start is used.
      
    For a 3-event definition [start, central, end]:
      - For each occurrence of the start event, the function searches for the first occurrence 
        of the central event and then the first occurrence of the end event following the central event.
      - If the central event is not found after a start event, a warning is issued and that cycle instance is skipped.
      - If the end event is not found after the central event, the cycle is considered incomplete and skipped silently.
    
    Parameters:
        event_times (list or array): The times corresponding to each event.
        event_labels (list): The event labels, aligned with event_times.
        cycles_from_to (dict): A dictionary mapping cycle names to a list of event labels.
                               The list must have either 2 or 3 elements.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where each key is a cycle name and the value is another dictionary.
              In the inner dictionary, each key is the cycle number (starting at 1) and the value
              is a tuple defining that cycle's time range.
              - For 2-event cycles, the tuple is (start_time, end_time).
              - For 3-event cycles, the tuple is (start_time, central_time, end_time).
